# Nanto

> The native frame for your web application.

Nanto is an early-stage .NET framework for building small native applications with web frontends. Its Windows-first design combines a raw Win32 host, the system WebView2 runtime, strongly typed generated C# ↔ TypeScript APIs, capability-based security, and Native AOT by default.

## Status

Nanto starts with Phase 1: a clean production implementation of the Windows host and lifecycle kernel. The first Milestone 1 increment now establishes the canonical solution and default project graph, portable contracts and validation, lifecycle state machines, repository-local test support, and fast dependency-boundary tests.

Nanto was renamed from Telaio after the feasibility work; commit [`90725e9`](https://github.com/ghidello/telaio/commit/90725e997fac3140ef4dd9f1a8ebd5d53db67642) records that historical boundary. Nanto has no source, build, report, or undocumented-decision dependency on the former repository. The architecture and Phase 1 plan state every adopted production rule directly.

## Documentation

- [Architecture and roadmap](docs/Nanto-architecture-and-roadmap.md)
- [Phase 1 implementation plan](docs/phase1-plan.md)
- [Contributor and coding-agent guidance](AGENTS.md)

## Requirements

The planned implementation targets Windows 10 22H2/build 19045 or newer on x64 and uses the .NET 10 SDK selected by [`global.json`](global.json).

## Development

The canonical default checks are:

```powershell
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

The Windows host, WebView2 integration, integration-test graph, and deployment modes have not been implemented yet.
